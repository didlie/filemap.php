# filemap.php
PHP 7 : text file manipulation class to search and append large text files in the shortest possible time.


Instructions:
1) Place 'filemap.php' and 'test_file_generator.php' in a folder called 'classes' in the root directory.
2) Create a file called 'index.php'
3) Instantiate the test_file_generator static method to create a unique 1000000 line file or larger, in your index file.
4) wait.... because step 3 takes a long time.
5) Comment out the static methods that created your test file.
6) Include 'filemap_test.php' in your index file and watch it run through millions of lines in less than 30 seconds.
7) Examine the code, test your ideas, and make improvements!
